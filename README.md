<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a stock screening, stock price tracking system just for myself. But with Alpaca Open API key and telegram Open API key, you can use this program as well.

Here's why I made this program:
* There are stock tracking programs, but they usually have number limits. Making my own program lets me customize notifications the way I want them to be.
* There are stock screening services everywhere. But I felt that with enough data, I can make one that is both customizable and automatic.
* Also I like to make stuff.
